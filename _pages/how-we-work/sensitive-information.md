## Tools to help developers

<!-- These are suggestions of tools. The VA should consider if this is a policy they want to follow -->

There are tools that will help developers avoid commiting sensiteve information into GitHub. These are just two options that are widely used.

- 18F/git-seekret: [https://github.com/18F/git-seekret](https://github.com/18F/git-seekret)
- awslabs/git-secrets: [https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)

Both of these tools rely on git hooks, specifically pre-commit hooks, to compliment developer workflows. While the tools help you set up these hooks please take a look at how to [customize git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) for further information on how this can help you with your workflow.

## Security Incidents
