Welcome to GitHub, a powerful platform for individuals and organizations to discover, share, and contribute to code — and to manage software (and other) projects.

The VA uses GitHub to manage collaboration around code and other projects in a way that meets VA security requirements. To that end, we'd like to share some helpful tips on accessing and securing your account :rocket::

## Joining the Department of Veterans Affairs organization on GitHub.com

After you [request access to the VA organization][11], you should receive an  email inviting you to join the VA organization. You'll need to agree to this before anyone can give you access to a private repository at the VA.

1. Before you can access repositories in the [Veterans Affairs Organization on GitHub][1], you will receive an invitation by email to join  the organization:
    1. Via email:

2. Click **View invitation**, for the details. On the next screen, you'll be asked to confirm that you want to join the org. 

    1. If you haven't yet set up 2FA, you'll find the `Enable two-factor authentication` button is active and the `Join Department of Veterans Affairs` button is disabled.
